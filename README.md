-Hello I am Danton Klein, an Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Master's student at the University of Florida. My areas of interest within ECE include embedded systems, systems programming, firmware engineering, asic/fpga design, and computer architecture. This is my github page, where I have both personal projects and projects from class that I find demonstrate experience with skills related to ECE. I'm always open to collaboration and you can contact me at dantonmklein@gmail.com
